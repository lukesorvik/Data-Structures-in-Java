# Project for implementing custom data Structures in Java

We were not allowed to use any data structures provided by Java; we were only allowed to use primitive data types and classes we built ourselves. On top of this, I wrote my own JUnit tests using techniques like fuzzy testing to test the data structures I implemented.

## This was a project where we implemented our own:

- **AVL Tree:**
  - A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains logarithmic height for efficient operations.

- **Chaining Hash Table:**
  - A hash table that uses any dictionary data structure as each bucket in the hashtable to chain elements. Supports separate chaining.

- **HashTrieMap:**
  - A map implementation using tries for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.

- **HashTrieSet:**
  - A set implementation utilizing tries for optimal storage and quick membership tests.

- **Array Stack:**
  - A stack implemented using arrays, dynamically growing as elements are added.

- **Circular FIFO Queue:**
  - A queue implemented using an array in a circular fashion, optimizing space usage and providing O(1) lookup time.

- **ListFIFOQueue:**
  - A queue implemented as a linked list for efficient operations.

- **MinFourHeap:**
  - A minimum heap with a custom comparator for comparing elements. Utilizes four nodes per parent for optimized heap operations.

- **Move-to-Front List:**
  - A linked list where new items are inserted at the front, and existing items move to the front upon reference.
- Heap sort
- Quick Sort
- TopK Sort


## Directory Structure

All implemented data structures can be found in the directory:
```bash
\src\main\java\datastructures
## All of the datastructures I implemented is in the directory: 
```bash
\src\main\java\datastructures
```
