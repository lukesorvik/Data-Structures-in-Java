# Project for implementing custom data Structures in java
We were not allowed to use any data structures provided by java, we were only allowed to use primative data types, and classes we build ourselves.
On top of this I wrote my own tests using techniques like fuzzy testing to test the data structures I implemented.

## This was a project where we implemented our own: 

- Avl Tree
- Chaining Hash Table = A hash table that uses any dictionary data structure as each bucket in the hashtable to chain elements
- HashTrieMap = A map using tries
- HashTrieSet = A set using tries
- Array Stack = array using a stack, that grows as you add items
- Circular FIFO QUEUE = used an array to implement a queue, circular in nature to optimize the space used in the array, and provide O(1) lookup time for any element in the queue
- ListFIFOQueue = Linked list
- MinFourHeap = Minheap, with custom comparator for how the objects are compared, uses 4 nodes instead of 2, and uses an array.
- Move to front list = a type of linked list where new items are inserted at the front of the list, and an existing item gets moved to the front whenever it is referenced
- Heap sort
- Quick Sort
- TopK Sort

## All of the datastructures I implemented is in the directory: 
```bash
\src\main\java\datastructures
```

## All of the Sorts I implemented is in the directory: 
```bash
\src\main\java\p2\sorts
